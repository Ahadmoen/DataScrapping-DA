# **Amazon Web Scraping and Machine Learning Project**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on extracting product data from Amazon using web scraping techniques, performing data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict product prices based on extracted features. The project demonstrates a transition from traditional data analysis (DA) to data science (DS) by employing both data preprocessing methods and a machine learning model for predictive analysis.

## **Project Motivation**
As a Data Analyst transitioning into Data Science, this project aimed to:
- Apply data scraping techniques to gather real-world data from Amazon.
- Clean and preprocess the data using advanced techniques like clustering for missing value imputation.
- Explore the transition from descriptive analysis to predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.
- Demonstrate the end-to-end process of a data science project, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

## **Data Collection**
The dataset was collected from Amazon using web scraping techniques. The main features extracted were:
- **Product Title**: Name of the product.
- **Price**: Price of the product.
- **Rating**: Customer rating of the product.
- **Review Count**: Number of reviews for the product.

**Tools and Libraries**:
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to Amazon's website.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For parsing HTML content and extracting relevant data.

## **Data Cleaning and Imputation**
After data collection, significant preprocessing was performed to ensure data quality:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were identified in the price and rating columns. To address this, we used **K-means clustering** for imputation.

### **Why We Used K-means Clustering for Imputation**
- **Context**: In typical scenarios, missing values can be filled using mean, median, or mode imputation. However, this approach does not account for the underlying structure or patterns in the data, potentially leading to biased or inaccurate imputations.
- **Advantage of K-means**: K-means clustering helps us identify **natural groupings** (or clusters) in the dataset. Products within the same cluster are more likely to share similar characteristics, such as price range and rating distribution.
- **Improved Data Imputation**: By imputing missing values based on cluster centroids (average values of features within clusters), we ensure that the filled values align with the patterns observed in similar products.
- **Data Science Relevance**: Using clustering for data imputation is a step towards integrating **unsupervised learning** into the data preprocessing pipeline, enhancing the quality of data used for subsequent modeling.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Due to the limited scope of features, EDA focused on understanding basic distributions:
- Analyzed the distribution of product prices and ratings.
- Identified the presence of skewness in the price data, indicating potential issues for predictive modeling.
- Performed basic visualizations like histograms and box plots to detect outliers.

### **Limitations in EDA**
- The dataset had a limited number of features, restricting in-depth analysis.
- Skewness in data and outliers suggested a need for additional data cleaning or transformation before modeling.

## **Machine Learning Model**
### **Model Chosen**
- **Random Forest Regressor**: A robust and interpretable machine learning algorithm for regression tasks.

### **Features and Target**
- **Features**: Rating, Review Count.
- **Target**: Price.

### **Model Evaluation**
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% training data and 20% testing data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was used to assess model performance.

### **Key Findings**
- The model showed potential but was limited by the narrow feature set and data quality issues.
- Residual analysis indicated the need for more features and further data preprocessing to reduce prediction errors.

## **Results and Evaluation**
- The initial model performance was limited by high skewness in the data, resulting in suboptimal predictions.
- Key metrics such as RMSE showed that while the model could capture some relationships, there was room for improvement in feature engineering and data quality.

## **Challenges Faced**
1. **Web Scraping Issues**:
   - Amazonâ€™s dynamic webpage structure required handling HTML changes and anti-scraping mechanisms.
2. **Data Quality**:
   - Significant missing data and skewed distributions affected the quality of EDA and predictive modeling.
3. **Limited Features**:
   - The dataset had only a few features, reducing the predictive power of the model.

## **Future Improvements**
1. **Enhance Data Collection**:
   - Implement **Selenium** for dynamic scraping to handle JavaScript-rendered content and expand the number of extracted features.
   - Add new features like product category, keyword sentiment analysis, or seller type to increase the dataset's richness.
2. **Advanced Data Cleaning**:
   - Apply transformations like **log scaling** to address skewness in the price data.
   - Explore other imputation techniques (e.g., regression imputation) and compare their performance with the clustering approach.
3. **Model Enhancement**:
   - Experiment with other models such as **XGBoost** or **Gradient Boosting Regressor**.
   - Perform **hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV for model optimization.
4. **Deepen EDA**:
   - With a richer dataset, conduct a more detailed EDA with correlation analysis, trend analysis, and advanced visualizations.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Collection: Requests, BeautifulSoup
  - Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the transition from traditional data analysis to data science by integrating web scraping, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning. The use of clustering for imputation and building a Random Forest model highlights a shift towards advanced predictive modeling. While the project showcased key skills in the data science pipeline, enhancing the dataset and model evaluation are necessary for future improvements.

The project was an excellent learning opportunity, reinforcing the importance of data quality and feature engineering in predictive modeling. It marks a significant step in moving from descriptive analysis to a predictive, data science-oriented approach.
