# Project Title: Gaming Product Data Analysis and Modeling  

## Overview  

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of gaming product data. The project encompasses data scraping, cleaning, and advanced modeling, offering insights into product pricing, ratings, and trends. The work is divided into three key stages:  

1. **Web Scraping**: Extracting gaming product data from an online marketplace.  
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Filling missing values using clustering techniques and addressing outliers.  
3. **Model Evaluation**: Analyzing the relationship between product features and understanding the limitations of the chosen models.

## Notebooks Overview  

### 1. **Web Scraping**  
- **Title**: Web Scraping (Gaming Products)  
- **Description**: Step-by-step extraction of gaming product data from an online platform using web scraping techniques.  
- **Key Sections**:  
  - Introduction to scraping methodology.  
  - Saving the extracted data into a CSV file for further analysis.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
- **Title**: Data Cleaning  
- **Description**: Correcting data types, addressing missing values, and clustering data for improved preprocessing accuracy.  
- **Key Sections**:  
  - **Why Use K-Means Clustering?**  
    Clustering is especially effective for data containing diverse product categories. Using K-means, we:  
    - Group similar products based on features like price and ratings.  
    - Handle missing values by leveraging group averages or medians, ensuring better imputation accuracy.  
    - Detect outliers and anomalies within each cluster, leading to cleaner datasets.  
  - Outlier detection and correction for price attributes.  
  - Determining optimal cluster numbers using the Elbow Method (optimal at k=3 or k=4).

### 3. **Model Evaluation**  
- **Title**: Model Evaluation  
- **Description**: Evaluating relationships between product features and analyzing the limitations of the chosen models.  
- **Key Sections**:  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on ratings and pricing.  
  - Heatmap visualization to identify key relationships.  
  - Limitations of Models:  
    - The evaluation revealed poor results due to insufficient data quality and complex relationships among variables.  
    - Instead of diving deeper into advanced models like deep learning, the focus shifted to improving data preprocessing and refining feature selection for better future modeling.
